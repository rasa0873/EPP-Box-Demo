# EPP Box Demo

## Android App based on Koylin and Java, and using Firebase (Firestore, Storage)

This App handles access to registered users to a Crossfit box, so each user can see the 
available workouts (WOD) and sign up or cancel a reservation to each WOD. 
The App uses Firebase email authentication to grant or deny access.

Users have three authority levels: Manager, Trainer and Athlete. As a Manager, you can create
workouts and as a Trainer, you can confirm the Athlete's attendance. As an Athlete, you can sign up or cancel
your reservation to each already-defined WOD.

Each user, regardless of their authority, has a profile (Android Activity) with individual information.
